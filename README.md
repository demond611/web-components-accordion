#### PROJECT 3 - ACCORDION COMPONENT

1. You will create an accordion menu to display the items list for a restaurant menu. Make use of HTML tags such as input, label, div, and others to structure the content, which we will style in the next task.
2. After having the HTML structure in place, let’s switch focus to the CSS part of the accordion.
- Identify any additional CSS selectors that you need in place to make the accordion work just like you did for tabs. You can modify any existing selectors and add new ones.
3. After completing Task 2, we have a working prototype of an accordion component. Let’s add a fourth item to this component to wrap up. Build upon the HTML and CSS code you created after Task 2 to add this new item.
- Add a fourth item to the list of accordion items in the HTML code and name it Soups & Salads. Place it after the Desserts radio button item, as indicated in the HTML code.
